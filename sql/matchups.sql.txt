-- STEP 1: SELECT SEED_ID

---- All in one approach

select s.user_id, s.submission_id,
( select max(matchup_id)
  from matchup m
  where m.seed_id = s.user_id ) as last_matchup_id,
( select max(game_id)
  from game g
  where g.seed_id = s.user_id ) as last_game_id  
from submission s
where s.latest = 1
order by
last_matchup_id asc,
last_game_id asc,
s.user_id asc
limit 1

---- Split approach
---- 1A: Look for new user without game seed (and valid submission)

------ left join method
select *
from submission s
left outer join game g on s.user_id = g.seed_id
where g.seed_id is null
and s.latest = 1
order by s.user_id asc
limit 1

------ not in method
select *
from submission s
where s.user_id not in (
    select g.seed_id
    from game g
)
and s.latest = 1
order by s.user_id asc
limit 1

---- 1B: Look for last seeded user
