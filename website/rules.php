<h2>Rules</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The final rankings will be determined using a computerized tournament
    designed by the contest organizer. The official results will be final.
    The ongoing rankings on the leaderboard are not official and may not
    be representative of the final results.</li>
  <li>You can only have one account. If you have effective control over more
    than one account, even if the accounts are all nominally owned by other
    people, you will be disqualified.</li>
  <li>Entries which are deemed to violate the spirit of fair and sportsmanlike
    competition will be disqualified without any opportunity for appeal.
    In particular, memory scanning, intentionally losing games, and behavior
    conditional on the opponent's identity are prohibited.</li>
  <li>You may not write to files. You may however read from files within your
    submission directory, which will be the current directory.</li>
  <li>Use of multiple processes or OS threads are prohibited.</li>
  <li>Any attempt to disrupt the normal operation of the contest software or
    the contest servers will result in the immediate involvement of law
    enforcement officials. Our policy is to always prosecute.</li>
  <li>We reserve the right to change these rules at any time without notice.</li>
</ul>
