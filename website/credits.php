<h2>Special Thanks</h2>
<p>The Google AI Challenge is designed, built, and operated completely by
  volunteers. As the number of participants has steadily grown, so has the
  amount of work required to make it all happen.</p>
<p>With the move to
  <a href="https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge">fully open-source</a>,
  many of the contestants have been contributing code to help us
  keep up with the volume of feature requests and bug fixes. <!--All-in-all,
  several dozen people have contributed to the design, implementation,
  and operation of the Fall 2010 Google AI Challenge. To all the hackers
  who sent us patches to fix bugs, created new and interesting visualizers,
  set up independent game servers, translated the starter packages into new
  languages, and told us how to fix the webserver whenever it got crushed by
  traffic spikes from Reddit, we are truly grateful.--> Thank you.</p>
<p>There are a few people who have been especially generous with their time
  and expertise. Our special thanks goes out to these individuals.</p>
<h3>Janzert</h3>
<p>Janzert was originally a contestant. He joined the core admin team so that
  he could work on improving and stabilizing the contest systems. <!--From October
  onwards, he was the primary operator of the entire contest backend,
  including the newly created cluster of game-playing servers. He boosted
  the throughput of the system from an average of 8 games per minute to
  our current level of 134, meaning that each submission gets to play a lot
  more games.--></p>
<p><!--Janzert contributed dozens of new features and bug fixes, eliminating
  90% of the problems that people found most frustrating about the contest.
  He is a machine.--></p>
<h3>Alex Stan</h3>
<p>Better known as amstan, Alex was in charge of the forums and the IRC
  channel. He worked tirelessly to make sure that people's questions got
  answered, and kept the development team focused on the things that
  mattered most to the contest participants.</p>
<p>Alex was the winner of the first Google AI Challenge.</p>
